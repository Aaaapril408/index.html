        <h2>By Bruce Sterling</h2>

       <p class="highlight"> If I had to guess, I'd say <em> years</em>. In 30 years, things properly understood as Spimes will be around us. </p>
        
        <p class="mmm">Mind you, this is by no means an entirely happy prospect. It's important to acknowledge the downsides of any technological transformation - to "think of the underside first", to think in a precautionary way.</p>

       <p> Nothing new there <a href="http://html.energy">html energy</a> - fire is <strong> million years old</strong>. It helps to learn about fire and its remarkable affordances. Not a lot is to be gained by simply flinging lit matches.</p>

        <p> book is for designers who want to be active agents in a technosocial world. I can't make you into a moral angel (because I'm not one myself and have little interest in being one), but I might help you understand that a future can be yours to make.</p>
