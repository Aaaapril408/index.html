  <h1> <br> I’d Like to Live with You<br></h1>
  <h2><br> by Marina Tsvetaeva<br></h2>
   <div><h3><p> <br>I’d like to live with You <br>
    In a small town,<br>
    Where there are eternal twilights
    eternal bells. <br>
    And in a <em> village inn—</em>
    <br>The faint chime <br>
    <em> ancient clocks—<br></em>
    like droplets of time. <br></p></h3>


   <h4> <p>And sometimes, in the evenings, from somegarret—
    A flute, <br>
    And the flautist himself in the window. <br>
    And<big> big </big>tulips in the window-sills. <br>
     And maybe, You would not even love me… <br></p></h4>


    <h5><p>In the middle of the room—a <big>huge</big> tiled oven, <br>
     On<em> each tile—</em>a<small> small </small>picture: <br>
     <em>A rose—a heart—a ship— <br></em>
    And in the <em>one window— <br></em>
    <strong>snow, snow, snow.</strong> <br></p></h5>


    <h6>You would lie—thus I love You:  <br><strong>
    idle,Indifferent, carefree.</strong><br>
    Now and then the sharp strike
    Of a match. <br>
    The cigarette glows and burns down, <br> 
    And trembles for a long, long time on its edge
    In<em> a gray brief pillar— of ash.</em><br>
    You’re too lazy <em> to flick it— </em><br>
    And the whole cigarette flies into the fire. <br></h6></div>
